Description:
- In my JavaFx project, I seamlessly integrated API calls to retrieve data from my colleague's backend.
- The user interface, crafted using SceneBuilder, boasts a polished appearance achieved through CSS styling.
- A notable feature of my application involves interaction with a CAEN RFID device.
- This specialized device facilitates the scanning of merchandise tags, streamlining the process.
- By connecting the RFID device to my application, I eliminated the need to manually input RFID codes for each item.
- Instead, I simply scan the tags using the connected device, and the corresponding RFID codes effortlessly populate the information tab for the asset.
